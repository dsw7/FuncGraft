# FuncGraft
Ultra lightweight CLI code editor. I tried [codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) but it felt too bloated,
led to code sprawl, and did not feel targeted enough for me. So I built my own equivalent that operates on
individual files.

ðŸš« _This code was not AI generated._ I do believe in leveraging AI tools for targeted code manipulations,
but I do not believe in letting AI do all the work.
